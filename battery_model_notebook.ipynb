    "- The battery can export any amount of power up to its maximum discharge rate for any \n",
    "duration of time, as long as it has sufficient energy stored to do so (And same with the charging -- needs storage)\n",
    "- Markets 1 and 2 are traded at half-hourly time granularity, whereas Market 3 is traded at daily \n",
    "granularity \n",
    "- The battery cannot sell the same unit of power into multiple markets, but can divide its power \n",
    "across the markets (The energy you give or take to the markets must add up to the total energy difference)\n",
    "- For the battery to participate in Markets 1 and 2, it must export/import a constant level of \n",
    "power for the full half-hour period \n",
